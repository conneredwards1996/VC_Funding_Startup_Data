# VC_Funding_Startup_Data

This project is to evaluate startup funding data for the years 1980-2013 in order to identify trends that correlate to startup success, for use by a hypothetical VC firm. The project leverages Python, SQL, and Tableau, with Excel used around the edges as well. The dataset consisted of 11 tables downloaded from Kaggle, originally found via Crunchbase.

To begin understanding the project, please download and read the Techincal Write Up, which has the project background information. From there, feel free to investigate as you see fit.
